Project: An API for managing a online forum

### Requirements:

- Must have disk-persistent storage
- Must support GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP requests
- Must have posts with title, author, and body
- Must have comments with author and body

## Guidelines

- Your project should have a descriptive README
- It should be fairly simple to install. We suggest publishing to a public package registry like NPM or PyPI, or compiling a binary and providing an easy download along with the SHA fingerprint. If you provide a binary or minified code, you must include source code as well as instructions to build/compile.
- ⚠️ In Development ⚠️
